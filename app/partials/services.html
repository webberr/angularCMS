        <p><b>CONSTRUCTION:</b>  Most often the customer will engage Paradigm Construction, LLC. with a completed design and a building permit in hand seeking pricing or a contract specifically for construction.  Depending on the customer’s preference, level of design completeness, and method of arriving at a project cost, there are different types of construction contracts to choose from.</p>
        <ul>
		<li><p><b>LUMP SUM CONTRACT:</b>  A Lump Sum Contract is used when the contractor provides a single lump sum price for a specific amount of work based either on the design or a well defined narrative clarifying the scope of work.  This price is not adjusted to reflect actual costs of the work provided the scope does not change.  With this method the customer knows the price of their project based on that design or narrative up front, but if definite quantities or definition of materials are lacking then a Lump Sum Contract may not be suitable.  This method is most commonly used when the customer is requesting bids from several contractors.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>UNIT PRICE CONTRACT:</b>  When the scope of work can be broken into well defined units of a consistent nature but quantities have not yet been determined by the customer then a Unit Price Contract may be utilized.  This type of contract is best suited for projects with limited scope as a more detailed project may result in an extensive list of quantities that can become tedious for both the customer and the contractor to manage.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>COST PLUS CONTRACT:</b>  For a project where the extent of the work cannot be defined when the agreement established (such when elements of the project are still being designed), a Cost Plus Contract may be the most suitable form.  With this method the actual direct costs associated with the construction project are presented to and paid by the customer in addition to a negotiated fee for the contractor.  The fee itself can be structured to best fit the specific project and can include a fixed fee, fixed percentage, or even a sliding scale that adjusts for incremental changes in the project size.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE CONTRACT:</b>   When the customer has a well defined scope of work and does not anticipate any changes in the work a Guaranteed Maximum Price Contract may be utilized.  This type of contract is used when the customer and the contractor are negotiating a price and the contractor assumes the risk for meeting that price and schedule.  Often times the risk can be minimized by negotiating allowances for elements of the work that are not defined.  The allowances are then reconciled against the actual cost for those elements once more definition is given.  Additionally with this type of contract there is often a negotiated split between the customer and the contractor for any savings in the total project cost.  </p></li>
		</ul
		<p><b>FEASIBILITY:</b>  The most common factor restricting the ability of a conceptual project from becoming reality is cost.  However, there are many other factors such as code compliance, zoning, and design limitations, just to name a few, that must be evaluated and overcome to bring a concept to the point of constructability.  Paradigm Construction, LLC. has relationships with and access to all of the necessary resources to evaluate every component of your conceptual project and determine whether your project is feasible for you given the limitations on resources that are available to you.  And the good news is that we can perform this service up front for a relatively small cost and reduce the amount of costly design revisions and legal road blocks that can surface during design, land use review, and the permitting process.    
</p>
		<p><b>ESTIMATING:</b>  Whether just a few ideas in someone’s head or a full set of drawings and book of specifications, Paradigm Construction, LLC. can put together as detailed or schematic an estimate for your project as you need.  When the estimate is based on documents or discussions that are not yet fully developed into specific materials or products, we will provide you with a detailed scope narrative letter to provide as much clarity as possible.  Estimates are provided at no cost to you and can be revised as needed while the design is evolving.  Additionally, Paradigm Construction, LLC. can assist you in the determining the most cost effective configuration of materials to accomplish your specific needs through the process of value engineering, which utilizes the trade specific knowledge of the subcontractors to find the most efficient way to meet the design criteria.  
</p>
		<p><b>PRECONSTRUCTION SERVICES:</b>  When a construction project is especially resource intensive for the contractor and/or subcontractors before the start of construction, as in the case of subcontractor designed mechanical or electrical systems for example, we may choose to enter into an agreement for preconstruction services.   Preconstruction services can include any of the other services listed on this page as well as permitting, design development, assistance with obtaining financing, land use and zoning reviews, or any task in which our expertise can provide you with needed assistance.  </p>
		<p><b>DESIGN BUILD:</b>  Some of our customers build multiple projects per year and have separate contracts with design consultants for design and permitting prior to engaging Paradigm Construction, LLC. for construction services.  However, many customers choose to minimize the number of contracts and time consumption required by them and simplify the overall process by entering into a Design Build contract.  This allows for us to be the primary point of contact for the customer from project conception through project completion.  Under a Design Build contract all design consultants required for permitting, code compliance, and customer specific performance requirements are hired by Paradigm Construction, LLC. </p>
		<p><b>CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT:</b>  For customers who wish to be more involved in the construction process and to have more control over every detail of the project accounting and documentation, they may wish to hire Paradigm Construction, LLC. for Construction Management services.  In this scenario we would act as the customer’s agent for facilitating all aspects of design and construction.  Contracts with design consultants and contractors are directly with the customer but are written and managed by us.  In this way all documents are available for the customer’s review without requiring an in depth knowledge of the process or consumption of as much time by the customer.  Construction Management services are provided for a negotiated hourly rate, reimbursable material costs, and a fee.</p>
